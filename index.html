	<p>Father,hallowed be your name,your kingdom come.Give us each day our daily bread.Forgive us our sins,for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.And lead us not into temptation (luke 11:2)</p><br>
	<p>God is good , all the time for in himself is where the whole thing have made. and you gave us your son jesus to be sacrifice for everyone's sin so we can reach to you . we were a sinner we desserved no more mercy except death. but now as your word say in the book of john chapter 1 verse 4 (In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.) we designed to be with God</p><br>
